<p>I always wanted to get started with window managers, but the learning curve kept me away. So on 1st February 2021, I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>Since I didn't want to mess up the primary system, I went with the virtual machine route. For the distro, I went with <a href="https://manjaro.org/download/#awesome">Manjaro's community build of awesome</a> after watching DistroTube's video.</p>
<p>The setup process was similar to that of any Manjaro installation. It took around 8-10 minutes to install, and after installation finished, the first problem I encountered was how to change the wallpaper. The easy solution was to install Nitrogen.</p>

<p>Next, it took me more than 2 hours to configure the setup, according to my daily usage.</p>

<p>Here is a list of applications that I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>URXVT (Terminal)</li>
<li>Ranger with W3M (Filemanager)</li>
<li>Firefox (Web Browser)</li>
<li>Rofi (Popup Window Switcher)</li>
<li>Mousepad (GUI Text Editor)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am delighted with my current setup, nothing too fancy or too minimal. Get's the job done.</p>
