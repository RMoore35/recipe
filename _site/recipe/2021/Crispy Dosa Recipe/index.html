<li>
<p>Add Â½ cup urad dal (skinned black whole lentils), 2 tablespoon chana dal (bengal gram) and Â½ teaspoon methi seeds to a large pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add 1Â½ cups rice to another pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse dals thoroughly a few times and soak in lots of water for 4 hours. During cold weather they can be soaked up to 6 hours or even overnight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rinse rice too a few times until the water runs clear. Soak in enough water for 4 hours. Same here as well, during cold weather they can be soaked up to 6 hours or even overnight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 mins before blending the batter, rinse and soak 2 tablespoons poha with Â¼ cup water for 30 mins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add soaked poha to the grinder jar or container first. Drain the water completely from dals and add them along with Â½ teaspoon non-iodized salt and Â¾ cup water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blend until smooth, frothy and bubbly. If needed add more water. I add another 2 to 4 tablespoons water. But do not make it thin or runny. It must be a thick batter yet of pouring consistency. (Check video for consistency)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the batter to a a large pot or bowl. Drain rice completely and add to the blender jar. Pour Â½ cup water. I use another 2 tbsps more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blend to a smooth batter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the rice batter to the urad dal batter. Mix both of them well with your hand. The warmth in the hand is said to help in fermentation. The prepared batter must be of pouring consistency yet thick and not runny.</p>
</li>
